This is my first official assignment on my software dev journey. 
It is Monday, and I am wicked tired today after playing basketball last night and then staying up until 1AM.
I also am going to be minting a VF2 at around 1PM, and then heading out to my Amazon shift at 2:30 - for which I want to aim to arrive at 2:15 - meaning I need to leave here
no later than 1:45. Leave at 1:40 to be safe/not rushed. 
Car also needs to be set up. 
How am I feeling about this project? Good, just tired.
