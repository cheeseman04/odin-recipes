    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 packages of fresh pizza dough. (Our personal fave is Trader Joes)</li>
        <li>1 pkg pepperoni</li>
        <li>1 can Pineapple chunks</li>
        <li>1 jar pizza sauce (refrigerated or shelf)</li>
        <li>2 bags (16 oz) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 pkg of Canadian bacon</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Set the dough out to achieve room temperature roughly 2-3 hours prior to preparation</li>
        <li>Wipe down and clean a prep area for rolling out the pizza dough. Put down some flour to keep the dough from sticking.</li>
        <li>Roll out the pizza dough into a flat, rough crust. Place it on a circular pizza baking sheet</li>
        <li>Top the rolled out dough with pizza sauce, cheese, and whatever additional ingredients are desired. Top with a few extra sprinkles of cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza at 425 degrees F for 10-11 minutes. Remove promptly to cool and serve.</li>
        <li>Following the instructions above, prepare and bake additional pizzas with toppings included as desired.</li>
    </ol>
